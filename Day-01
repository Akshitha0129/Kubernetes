1. Control Plane Components
The Control Plane is the central management entity in Kubernetes. It ensures that the cluster operates as desired by managing workloads, networking, and interactions with the cloud provider.

a. kube-apiserver
The entry point to the Kubernetes control plane.
Exposes the Kubernetes API, which all other components and external clients interact with.
Acts as the primary interface for resource management and communication within the cluster.

b. etcd
A highly available, distributed key-value store.
Persists the cluster's state and configuration data, such as pod definitions, service information, and node statuses.
Ensures consistent state across the cluster.

c. kube-scheduler
Responsible for assigning pods to nodes based on resource requirements, affinity/anti-affinity rules, and availability.
Considers factors such as CPU, memory, and custom policies to make scheduling decisions.

d. kube-controller-manager
Combines multiple controllers into a single binary (e.g., Node Controller, Replication Controller, and Endpoint Controller).
Monitors the cluster state and ensures that the desired state matches the actual state.

e. cloud-controller-manager
Manages cloud-specific functionality, enabling Kubernetes to integrate with cloud providers.
Handles:
Node lifecycle management.
Load balancer provisioning.
Persistent storage integration.
Route configuration.

2. Worker Node Components
Worker nodes are where workloads (applications) run. Each node has the necessary components to manage, monitor, and run pods.

a. kubelet
A Kubernetes agent running on every node.
Responsible for ensuring that the containers defined in pod specifications are running and healthy.
Communicates with the kube-apiserver to receive instructions and send updates.

b. kube-proxy
Manages network rules for the node.
Implements Kubernetes networking to route traffic between services, pods, and external clients.
Maintains load balancing across pods in a service.

c. Pods
The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, consisting of one or more containers.
Containers within a pod share the same storage and network namespace.
Each pod is scheduled on a node by the control plane.

3. Cloud Provider API
An interface for Kubernetes to interact with the underlying cloud infrastructure.
Used by the cloud-controller-manager to provision resources such as virtual machines, load balancers, and storage volumes.
